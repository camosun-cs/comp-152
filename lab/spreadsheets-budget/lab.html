        <h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this lab assignment you will learn about:</p>
        <ul>
            <!-- list learning outcomes here -->
            <li>Entering data efficiently</li>
            <li>Using formulas and the SUM Function</li>
            <li>Referencing other cells</li>
            <li>Autofill and its options</li>
            <li>Worksheets and Workbooks</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- optional additional contextual introduction -->
        <!-- <h3>What is a Spreadsheet?</h3>

        <p>Spreadsheets could be called number processing software as opposed to
        Word, which is word processing software.  All spreadsheet software
        (including Excel,
        Lotus and QuattroPro) is based on a table format â€“ numbers (and text)
        are entered into cells, which are organized into rows and columns.
        A spreadsheet can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Format data or calculations into an attractive table;</li>
            <li>Perform complicated or repetitive calculations;</li>
            <li>Analyze empirical (laboratory) data and determine the equation
                that best fits the data;</li>
            <li>Graph data in many types of graphs;and</li>
            <li>Store data in a database (although Excel is not as versatile
                or powerful as the Microsoft Access database program).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>

        <p>A spreadsheet would be suitable for the following applications:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Calculating your tax return;</li>
            <li>Preparing a cost estimate for a construction project;</li>
            <li>Recording and calculating your marks on tests and assignments
                and then calculating each students final grade;</li>
            <li>Estimating the flow rates in a drainage or sewerage analysis and
                calculating what pipe diameter would be required to pass the
                flow;</li>
            <li>Calculating mortgage payments given the principal, interest rate
                and number of payments, calculating the balance owing after each
                payment;</li>
            <li>To count the number of days / minutes / seconds until the year
                2010 (or any other date)</li>
            <li>Calculating the amount in an investment account each month for
                20 years;</li>
            <li>Calculating and graphing stress and strain and graphing the
                results in a lab; and</li>
            <li>Performing statistical analysis (such as calculating the
                standard deviation) of a large number of data points.</li>
        </ul> -->

        </ul>
            <p>This <strong>Workbook</strong> contains the start of a budgeting template. Your task is to complete it and fill it with sample data. The first step is to fill in the functions and formulas for the first month. This will save time when the later months are added with autofill.</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Click <a href="resources/budget.xlsx">here</a> to download <samp>budtget.xlsx</samp>, then open it in Microsoft Excel.</li>

                <aside>After typing in the desired value into a cell, pressing the <samp>Enter</samp> key will confirm the value, then automatically move the selection to the next cell below, ready for more input. This lets you enter data quickly without needing the mouse.</aside>
            </li>
            <li>In the <samp>Total Expenses</samp> field, use the <code>SUM()</code> function to add up the values in the four cells above: B2 to B5.</li>
            <details>
                <summary>Using the Function Builder</summary>
                <p>The <code>SUM</code> function returns the sum total of one or more cell values. One way to enter this function is using Excel's <samp>Insert Function</samp> utility. This utility can be useful when trying to find and/or use a function you are unfamiliar with.</p>
                <p>First make sure the cell to receive the function is selected. B6 in this case.</p>

                    <p>A cell address can be used in any part of a formula to use that cell's displayed value instead, even if that cell is in itself another formula. To insert an address, select the desired cell or cell range with the mouse while the formula is still being edited. The address will be added at the text pointer's position. The address can also be typed in manually.</p>
                    <aside><p>A cell address consists of a Column letter(s) and a Row number. For example: <code>A1</code>, <code>F28</code>, <code>GB102</code>.</p><p>For a group of cells, use the address of the two cells in opposing corners of the box selection, with a <code>:</code> in between. Example: <code>A1:F2</code>, <code>X50:B2</code></aside>
                    <p>The act of fetching the values of other cells is known as a <strong>reference</strong>. References will automatically update their values if the cell they're referring to changes, which will then update the result of your formula. You can see this in action by changing one of the individual expense fields.</p>

                    <p>The address to one or more rows looks like <code>startRow#:endRow#</code>. If only a single row is needed, <code>startRow#</code> and <code>endRow#</code> are the same. Ex: 2:2, 4:8. When building a formula, you can click the row's heading number with the mouse to quickly select and reference it. The same applies for selecting columns.</p>
                    <p>There's nothing special required to use a functions. Simply typing its name followed by parentheses <code>()</code> into the formula bar (that begins with <code>=</code>) is enough to call it. The cell references you want to feed it go between the parentheses. Look at the code you created with the function builder in cell B6's formula bar for an example.</p>

        <h2>All About Autofill</h2>
        <figure><img src="img/autofill_date.png"></figure>
        <p>Now that the required formulas and styles are working for one month, it's time to fill out the remaining months. This budget table will only cover September to December, but these principles will work on any table of any length.</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>
                <p>Begin by using <strong>autofill</strong> to fill out the remaining 3 months. Keep an eye on the helpful tooltip that displays the last result of the fill (Dec here).</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Autofill basics</summary>
                    <figure class="right"><img src="img/autofill.png"></figure>
                    <p>Selected cells will have a small box in the bottom-right corner of the selection area. If you click and drag this into adjacent cells, Excel will intelligently generate data based on the selected content into the new cells.</p>
                    <p>For example, if the selected cells contain the first few numbers of a simple pattern (such as three cells with 0, 1, and 2), Excel will generate more numbers that follow the sequence.</p>
                    <p>If the selected cell contains a formula, that formula will be filled into the new cells, and any relative references will be automatically updated to point to the next cell in the direction being filled in.</p>
                    <p>Any formatting or styles applied to the source cell will also fill over by default.</p>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The next three rows will likely be changing each month, so they don't need their results copied over, only the way they're formatted. Fill them to the right as well, and set them to <samp>Fill Formatting Only</samp>.</p>
                <aside>You can autofill these three rows at the same time. Just box-select the desired source cells first. Remember: the source cell must be the data, not its header.</aside>
                <details>
                    <summary>Autofill Options</summary>
                    <figure class="right"><img src="img/autofill_options.png"></figure>
                    <p>After every fill operation, a small button will pop up in the bottom right corner of the selection. Clicking this reveals options to apply to the previous fill.</p>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The remaining four rows (<samp>Rent, Total Expenses, Income, Net Income</samp>) don't need to follow a pattern like the month headers, nor remain empty like the expenses. Rent and Income are (hopefully) consistent each month, and the formulas need to apply to each column. Use the <samp>Copy Cells</samp> autofill on these remaining rows to satisfy these requirements.</p>
                <aside>The default action, <samp>Fill Series</samp>, would still work as expected with formulas and functions. It copies them over to the new cells and updates the references accordingly. Using <samp>Copy Cells</samp> just lets us to fill all these rows at once. Don't worry about including the blank row in the initial selection; a copy of nothing is still nothing.</aside>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All that remains is to add the rest of your expenses to the budget table. If everything has been done correctly, the <samp>Balance</samp> field should slowly deplete as you input more expenses. Did you stay within your budget?</p>
                <aside>As mentioned earlier, the <samp>Enter</samp> key advances to the cell below the current cell. Similarly, the <samp>Tab</samp> key advances to the next cell to the right. A trick involving both of these shortcuts is that, after using <samp>Tab</samp> to fill in multiple cells in a line, pressing <samp>Enter</samp> will advance to the beginning of the next line, right below the first cell you started on. See if you can quickly fill in all the empty expense fields, starting with C2, without touching the mouse.</aside>
