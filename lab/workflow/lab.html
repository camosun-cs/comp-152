                    You can organize the files on your computer and on connected network drives
                    using the <samp>File Explorer</samp> program in Windows. You can open this
                    application by double-clicking on any folder on your desktop (or the
                    <samp>My Computer</samp> icon), or opening it from the Start menu or task bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The left-hand sidebar of every Explorer window shows a collapsable list of
                    common locations. The <samp>Computer</samp> section includes all attached
                    drives and devices, and the <samp>Network</samp> section includes
                    drives available over the network.  Your "M" drive (often written
                    "M:\") is a network drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main content area of an Explorer window shows the contents of a
                    single selected folder. If you've selected your M drive from the
                    sidebar, the main area will show the files stored in your M drive. In
                    general, you can drag and drop files into this area to store them in
                    the selected folder, or drag files out to remove them. You can also use standard
                    <em>cut &amp; paste</em> commands to move files in the same way. You can create copies
                    by holding down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while dragging, or by using
                    <em>copy</em> instead of cut commands. Because your M drive is a network
                    drive, dragging files in and out of it will <em>copy</em> files instead
                    of moving them by default; use <kbd>Shift</kbd> to reverse this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create a new folder, click the <samp>New Folder</samp> button near the
                    top of the Explorer window. Immediately after pressing the button, the
                    folder name will be highlighted and can be changed simply by typing the
                    name you want and pressing enter. If you'd like to change its name later,
                    right-click on the folder and choose <samp>Rename</samp> from the
                    contextual menu.

            Open Microsoft Excel, and create a new blank workbook.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create these 3 headings: <strong>Base 10</strong>, <strong>Base 2</strong>, and <strong>Base 16</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter the numbers 0 through 9 in the <strong>Base 10</strong> column. Don't forget about the "fill-down" feature of excel to save some typing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Use the <strong>BASE</strong> function to calculate the values of the other 2 rows.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Excel Functions</summary>
                <p>
                    If a cell's content starts with an equals sign "=", it will be
                    interpretted as a <em>function</em>. Functions compute a value to be
                    displayed using math and logic. For example, "<samp><kbd>=2+2</kbd></samp>"
                    would compute the result of 2+2 and display 4 as the content of the cell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>BASE</b> function
                    transforms a decimal number into a number in another base system (such
                    as binary or hexadecimal). To use it, type <kbd>=BASE(</kbd>, followed
                    by the number to convert, a comma, the number of the base system to
                    convert to (eg. "2" for binary, or "16" for hexadecimal), and a closing
                    <kbd>)</kbd>. For example, "<kbd>=BASE(10, 16)</kbd>" would result in
                    "<samp>A</samp>" (10 in hexadecimal).  Instead of entering the number
                    to convert explicitly, you can specify a cell that contains the number
                    you want: for example, "<kbd>=BASE(A1,2)</kbd>" would
                    convert the number found in cell A1 into base-2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cells containing functions can be "filled-down" in the same way as
                    regular values, and cell references will be automatically adjusted.
                    For example, if column A contains numbers to convert and you enter
                    <kbd>=BASE(A1,16)</kbd> in the first cell in column B and then
                    fill-down, the A1 reference will be adjusted to target the cell in the
                    same row as each filled cell (eg A2, A3, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll learn more about functions in Excel in a later lab.

            Apply some light formatting to your spreadsheet. For example, add some distinguishing features to the headings and align all the numbers the same way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Save the document as BaseConversions.xlsx.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Use <strong>Save As</strong> to save it again as a CSV (comma delimited). Select 'Yes' in the dialog window that pops up asking if you want to keep using this format, since we will come back to this soon. You will now have 2 copies of this spreadsheet: the original .xlsx that preserves the formatting and formulas, and a .csv, which contains only the raw information.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>What is CSV</summary>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="Comma-separated values">CSV</abbr>
                    ("<em>C</em>omma-<em>s</em>eparated <em>v</em>alues") is a <strong>plain-text</strong>
                    format for storing tabular data. Each row of the table is stored
                    on a single line in the file, and each column within a row is
                    delimited using commas. Because of this file type's simple structure,
                    individual cells may not contain multiple lines of text and may not
                    contain commas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A closely-related format, <abbr title="Tab-separated values">TSV</abbr>,
                    uses tabs instead of commas to delimit columns. This allows cells to
                    contain commas, intead prohibiting them from containing tabs.

            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>More about file names and extensions</summary>
                <p>
                    Two files in one folder may never have the same name. Windows will warn you
                    that it will overwrite an existing file if you attempt to save a file with
                    a name that is already in use.  However, the names of files usually
                    also include a "file extension" that specifies the file's type, and so
                    two files <em>may</em> have the same name if their types (and extensions)
                    are different!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Windows normally hides file extensions by default, since they are
                    important for distinguishing the file's type and should not normally be
                    changed by hand. However, it is sometimes useful to be able to see these
                    type extensions in order to differentiate files with similar names.
                </p>
                <p>To show file extensions in Windows 7,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the <samp>Organize</samp> button in any Explorer window</li>
                    <li>Choose <samp>Folder and Search Options</samp> from the pop-up menu</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    These options differ depending on the content being pasted. Some of the options are:

    </figure>
    <p>This task will be using a web tool located at <a href="https://hexed.it/">https://hexed.it</a>. This tool is known as a <strong>Hex Editor</strong>. If a file is opened by dragging it into the window or by clicking the <strong>Open file</strong> button at the top, it will display its raw binary data represented in base 16 (hexadecimal). Don't worry about grasping the specifics and underlying functionality of this tool, you probably will never use it again, just understand that the middle column shows the hex, and to the right of that is what each byte of hex (2 digits) translates to in ASCII. You can also click on a byte to change its value, and export and download the modified file using the <strong>Export</strong> button at the top.</p>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Open BaseConversions.<strong>csv</strong> in <a href="https://hexed.it">hexed.it</a>.</li>

        <aside>These files that use a text encoding standard like this are called <strong>plain-text</strong>. Their simplicity makes it very easy for apps to understand them, and makes them required for tasks such as programming. It does however mean they cannot support the more advanced formatting features Microsoft Office can achieve. Try opening BaseConversions.<strong>xlsx</strong> in hexed.it, and you will see that it is basically gibberish.</aside></li>

                <p>
                    The <samp>logo.bmp</samp> image is encoded in an uncompressed format
                    which is simple enough to be partially read and manipulated by hand. The file starts
                    with some metadata that describes the format of the image (and which is
                    not easily understandable), but the majority of the file is composed of
                    sequences of color values ranging from 00 to FF as you've seen in
                    lab assignment 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Images in general are made up of a series of dots called
                    "pixels" (short for "pixel elements"). In a "24-bit bitmap" image like
                    this one, each pixel is recorded one after the other in the file,
                    with each pixel's colour described by three 8-bit numbers (2 hex digits
                    each) for the amount of red, green, and blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most image formats you may be familiar with (such as GIF or JPEG)
                    do not encode their colour values quite so simply, and so would not
                    be at all understandable in a hex-viewer. These image formats make
                    use of <em>compression</em> to reduce the size of the file by removing
                    redundant information.

            <p>Starting anywhere from the 5th row onward, replace a several bytes with new values. You can just click on a byte and then hold down the 0 key for a bit, or you could try scattering different hex values throughout the file.</p>
            <aside>
                The first few rows or so contain descriptive information for the file. If you were to modify any of these bytes, it could make the image un-readable.

    <p>Your final deliverable for this lab is a Word document containing a table, a linked spreadsheet, two images, and three written answers.</p>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li><p>Before submitting, go over your document to make sure it's presentable. Check:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>All objects are displaying correctly and positioned as desired.</li>
                <li>That the document headings and sections are logically structured (use the navigation pane)</li>
                <li>The visual style of the document is consistent</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Select the 4 entries in your Lab 5 folder: BaseConversions.csv, BaseConversions.xlsx, Lab5.docx, and the Images directory (containing 2 images).</p>

                <summary>Selecting multiple files</summary>
                <p>
                    You can select multiple files in Explorer in order to move them
                    or apply an action to them all at once. Hold down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
                    key while clicking to add items to the selection, or to deselect
                    items that are already selected.  Alternately, click and drag in a
                    blank area near the items you wish to select: Windows will show a
                    semi-transparent selection rectangle while the mouse button is held
                    down and will select any items that this rectangle overlaps.
                </p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            Right-click one of the selected files and pick <samp>Send to -&gt; Compressed (zip) folder</samp>. Your documents will be copied into a new compressed folder which, along with having a reduced filesize, can be moved and shared as a single file.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rename the compressed folder <samp>Lab6_Firstname_Lastname.zip</samp>, and then submit your assigment to the Lab 5 dropbox on D2L.
        </li>
    </ol>

        <b>NOTE</b>: This assignment is to be done <em>individually</em>. You can
        help one another with problems and questions, but in the end everyone must
        do their own assignment.
