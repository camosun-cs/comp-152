        <h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this lab assignment you will learn about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using the slide master to style your slide show</li>
            <li>Embedding and formatting media</li>
            <li>Recording and presenting your slide show</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="task1">Slide Master</h2>

        </figure>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>
                <p>Enter <strong>Slide Master</strong> view by clicking <samp>Slide Master</samp> in the <samp>View</samp> ribbon.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>About Slide Masters</summary>
                    <figure>

                    <p>The <strong>slide master</strong> is the template slide from which new slides get their layout and styles. Using slide masters properly will not only save you time, but also keep your presentation consistent.</p>
                    <p>Each slide master can contain several slide <strong>layouts</strong>. A layout defines a default set of elements and their position. When you begin creating your slide show, each layout will appear in the <samp>New Slide</samp> dropdown in the <samp>Home</samp> tab.</p>
                    <p>If set up properly, each slide in your presentation will inherit its style and elements from a layout which will, in turn, inherit from a single slide master. This means you only have to create any style or layout once, and then reuse it for each applicable slide. <strong>You never need to manually edit an individual slide element's style.</strong></p>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the slide master if it isn't already and create a consistent style for your presentation.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Themes</summary>
                    <p>PowerPoint comes with several themes, available in the <samp>Themes</samp> dropdown. These change the look of everything, including fonts, colors, and backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>After picking a theme, or sticking with the default plain and simple Office Theme, you can edit each aspect of the theme yourself. Just make sure you only edit in the slide master, so you won't have to repeat yourself on each new slide.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fonts, colors, and effects can be changed in the <samp>Background</samp> section in the <samp>Slide Master</samp> ribbon.</li>
                        <li>Individual elements (text, images, etc.) can be styled by first clicking the element, then opening the <samp>Format</samp> ribbon.</li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                To change any of the default included layouts, select them under the slide master. New elements can be added using the <samp>Insert Placeholder</samp> dropdown.
            </li>
            <li>New layouts can be created with the <samp>Insert Layout</samp> button in the <samp>Edit Master</samp> section. They can then be renamed or deleted using the buttons in the same section, or by right-clicking them and selecting the applicable option.</li>
            <li>If you need to have multiple styles in the same presentation, multiple slide masters can be used. Use the <samp>Insert Slide Master</samp> button. The new style and its layouts will appear in the <samp>New Slide</samp> dropdown. This is usually not necessary for short presentations like this assignment.</li>
            <li>Once you're happy with the look of your presentation, exit Master View using the close button in the ribbon. Adding new slides using the dropdown in the Home ribbon will now show your styled layouts.</li>
            <li>As long as you don't override a slide's inherited style by manually adjusting or styling its elements (which you should never do if you plan to do it more than once), you can edit the slide master at any time to change its style.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="task2">Embedded Media</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="powerpoint/ribbon-insert.png" alt="insert ribbon"/>
        </figure>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>The <samp>Insert</samp> ribbon contains buttons for embedding pictures, videos, and audio in your slide show.</li>
            <li>
                <p>After an image or video has been inserted, it can be resized and positioned by first selecting it, then using the drag handles. Use the corner handles to keep the element's proportions correct</p>
                <aside>
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> you can hold the <kbd>control</kbd> button down while resizing to keep the element centered.
                </aside>
            </li>
            <li>The <samp>Format</samp> ribbon (available after selecting an element) contains options for styling the element, as well as precise positioning options, including a useful <samp>Align</samp> dropdown in the <samp>Arrange</samp> section.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="task3">Presenting Your Slide show</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="powerpoint/ribbon-slideshow.png" alt="slideshow ribbon"/>
        </figure>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Notes can be added to each slide by using the <samp>Notes Pane</samp>, the button for which is found in the <samp>View</samp> ribbon or in the bottom status bar. Notes added here will be shown to you while presenting, allowing you to script out your commentary.</li>
            <li>To start a slide show for live presenting, use the options in the <samp>Start Slide Show</samp> section of the <samp>Slide Show</samp> ribbon.</li>
            <li>
                <p>A slide show can also be set up to play automatically along with recorded commentary using the <samp>Record Slide Show</samp> option.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Recording Slide Shows</summary>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The <samp>Record Slide Show</samp> option saves slide timings (how long each slide is displayed) and can also record your voice for fully automated presentations.</p>
                    <p>Upon starting a slide show recording, you can use the Presenter View window that pops up to give your presentation the same way you would in a live setting. However, you also have the option to re-record just the current slide if you make a mistake.</p>
                    <p>You can delete recorded audio and timings using the <samp>Clear</samp> option in the <samp>Record Slide Shop</samp> dropdown.</p>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To play the recorded presentation, ensure the <samp>Play Narrations</samp> and <samp>Use Timings</samp> options are checked, then start the slide show normally. If you are unhappy with the results, recording again will overwrite the previous result.</p>
                <aside>If you need to do a live presentation with manual slide control, un-check <samp>Play Narrations</samp> and <samp>Use Timings</samp>.</aside>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you now save your project as a PowerPoint Show: <kbd>.ppsx</kbd> (as opposed to the default <kbd>.pptx</kbd>), the resulting file will contain everything it needs to run your presentation anywhere with PowerPoint installed. Double-clicking this file will immediately launch and start the presentation.
                You can still open and edit <kbd>.ppsx</kbd> files normally by opening them through PowerPoint.
            </li>

    <section id="submission">

        <ul>
            <li>Clear, concise slides</li>
