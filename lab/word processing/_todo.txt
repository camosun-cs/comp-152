might want to redo ribbon images to be narrower
bullets inside details need single-line option (when inside <p>?)
definition list isn't working well to display sources
a lot of details are missing <samp> around needed items. eg: Source Manager
'navigation_pane' image should be outside the <li> so it is full-width
'navigation_pane' has an error in section 'E. Governmental Restrictions' > a)
table of figures and captions need more explanation

consider cutting 'cross-references' bit
we really need to get a shorter and better base document, along with some in-line annotations to show where to bullet and stuff
mention draft view as a way to see section breaks
