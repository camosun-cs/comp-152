         <li>    Create a folder in the COMP152 directory called <strong>Lab 9</strong>. All further work in this assignment will be done in this folder.

    <aside class="note">You may also want to create applicable directories to organize all your other work done so far in this course.</aside> 
        At this point, you should be comfortable with organizing your work in files and managing your data.

        <li>
            Open Microsoft Excel, and create a new blank workbook.
        </li>
            
        </details>
     <li>Create a new sheet in the workbook and name it <kbd>Invoice</kbd></li>

    <li>Add the heading <kbd>COMP152 Sales Invoice</kbd> at the top of new
sheet.</li>
    <li>Just beneath the main heading, add a <samp>Date</samp> label and space
            to record a date.</li>
        <li>Add a <samp>Customer</samp> label with space for five rows of content.</li>
    
     
        <li>Beneath that, layout a table with five rows and six columns labelled:
            <ul>
                <li><samp>Product</samp></li>
                <li><samp>Description</samp></li>
                <li><samp>Cost</samp></li>
                <li><samp>PPU</samp></li>

            <samp>Amount Due</samp>, and <samp>Payment Method</samp>.
            Make sure to leave at least two blank cells next to
            payment method.</li>
    <li>Add your style for wow factor.
    <details class="info">
                <summary>Style</summary>
            <p>Use borders, backgrounds, font-styles, and cell-merging to
            differentiate labels from input fields and make the form look
                appealing.</p>
            <p>Arrange the elements of your form to clearly show the
            relationship between fields (eg. <samp>Subtotal</samp> will
            eventually show the sum of amounts in the <samp>Total</samp> column)
            and ensure there is enough space in each input field to for the
            data it will likely hold.</p>
            <aside class="note">
                A large part of your "Wow factor" mark will come from this

                <summary>Formatting </summary>
                <ol>
                <li>Apply currency formatting to every every cell that will show
            a dollar amount (eg. <samp>Cost</samp>, <samp>Tax</samp>,
            <samp>Subtotal</samp>, etc.).</li>
               <li>Apply a YYYY/MM/DD date formatter to the date input cell.</li>     
                    
                </ol>
             </details>
        
        <li>Use the <code><samp>VLOOKUP</samp></code> function to automatically
            fill the <samp>Description</samp> and <samp>PPU</samp> fields of the
            invoice based on the given
            <samp>Product</samp> code and the list of merchandise on the
            <samp>Products</samp> sheet.</li>
        <li>Add a formula to calculate the value of the <samp>Cost</samp> column
            for each line item by multiplying the <samp>PPU</samp> by the
            <samp>Quantity</samp>. Use the <code><samp>IF</samp></code>
            function to apply a 5% discount if more than 10 units of the
            same type are ordered.</li>
        <li>Use the <code><samp>SUM</samp></code> function to automatically fill
            the <samp>Subtotal</samp> field with the sum of the <samp>Cost</samp>
            column and the <samp>Taxes</samp> field with the sum of the
            <samp>Tax</samp> column.</li>
        <li>Use a formula to fill the <samp>Amount Due</samp> field with the
            value of <samp>Subtotal</samp> plus the value of
            <samp>Taxes</samp> less the value of <samp>Credits</samp>.</li>
        <li>Use a combination of <code><samp>IF</samp></code> and
            <code><samp>VLOOKUP</samp></code> to show the customer's
            credit-card number next to the <samp>Payment Method</samp> field
            if the chosen method is <samp><kbd>Credit Card</kbd></samp>.</li>
        <li>Check that all of your formulas work correctly by adding two or
            three products to your invoice.

    <h2>Task 2: Validation and Text manipulation <small>(10 marks)</small></h2>
    <ol class="instructions">

            <aside class="info">
                <em>Hint:</em> You should create a new sheet to do this cleanly!
            </aside>
        </li>
        <li>Add a data validator to the first line next to the <samp>Customer</samp>
            input field to ensure it is the name of an existing customer from the
            <samp>Customers</samp> sheet.</li>
        <li>Use <code><samp>VLOOKUP</samp></code> to fill in the street address,
            city, province, and postal code of the customer in the spaces below
            their name.</li>
        <li>Use the <code><samp>CONCATENATE</samp></code> function to combine
            the customer's city and province into a single cell, separated by
            a comma (eg. "Toronto, Ontario").</li>
        <li>Use a combination of <code><samp>MATCH</samp></code>,
            <code><samp>INDEX</samp></code>, and <code><samp>UPPER</samp></code>
            to add the customer's company name in capital letters.
            <aside class="info">Because the company name is to the <em>left</em>
             of the customer name, you won't be able to use

            At the end of this step, your data next to the customer field should
            look something like this:
            <pre><code>Mr. Peabody James
INLAND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES
1234 Nowhere Ln.
Toronto, Ontario
M4N 9N8</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Use <code><samp>REPT</samp></code>, <code><samp>RIGHT</samp></code>,
            and <code><samp>LEN</samp></code>
            to adjust the formula for the customer's credit card number so that
            only the last 4 digits are shown and all other digits are replaced
            with <samp>X</samp>'s (eg. <samp>XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-0305</samp>).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Modified spreadsheet with automatically-filled customer details,
