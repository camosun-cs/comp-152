        <h2>Task 2: Extrapolating formulas</h2>
        <figure><img src="img/tank-template.png" alt="tank table example"></figure>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>
                Create a new <strong>worksheet</strong> titled <samp>Tank Volume</samp> and replicate the above table.
                <details>
                    <summary>Superscripts</summary>
                    <figure><img src="img/format-cells.png"></figure>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type the full desired text including the characters to be superscripted. ex: <code>m3/sec</code></li>
                        <li>Select the characters you want to modify, either directly in the cell or in the formula bar.</li>
                        <li>The superscript option is in the <samp>Format Cells</samp> window, accessible in the cell's Right-Click context menu, or in the <samp>Font</samp> section's expanded options in the Home ribbon.</li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>Using autofill, enter the numbers 0 to 30 under the <samp>Time</samp> column, starting in cell A10.</li>
            <li>We know that, for time 0, the volume is still equal to the initial volume found in cell B4. The formula to calculate the volume at any point in time is: <pre><code>Initial Volume + Elapsed Time * Fill Rate</code></pre> Enter this formula into cell B10, the Volume column, substituting the cell references <code>B4</code> and <code>B5</code> in place of <samp>Initial Volume</samp> and <samp>Fill Rate</samp>, and the adjacent cell <code>A10</code> for the <samp>Elapsed Time</samp>. At Time = 0, this equation should return 20, the value of Initial Volume.</li>
            <li>Autofill the formula in B10 down for all the time intervals. Unless you've been keeping one step ahead, you'll very likely see that the results are not as expected, with most of the cells failing to evaluate. Checking the formula on one of the broken cells should show an idea of what went wrong. Like the previous task, the interval part of the formula is updating correctly for each cell, but the other two references are not. In fact, they shouldn't be updating at all. To make a reference that doesn't change during autofill, an <strong>absolute reference</strong> must be used.
            <details>
                <summary>Absolute References</summary>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, using a plain cell address in a formula creates a relative reference, which is dynamically updated when using autofill. If, instead, the reference needs to always target the same cell, as is the case when referencing a single constant number, make it an absolute reference by prefixing the row <strong>and/or</strong> column character in the address with a <code>$</code>, for example, <code>$B$5</code>. If either the row or column address is left un-prefixed, the reference will still be relative in that direction only.</p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>The formulas <kbd><samp>=C2, =H$2, =$M$2</samp></kbd> were applied to each of the blue cells, then filled to the grey cells. Take note that the first two examples are still able to reference the negative columns, whereas the third always references M2.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </details>
            </li>
            <li>Correct the formula in cell B10 to use absolute references for B4 and B5, then autofill it down again. It's OK to fill over previously filled cells; they will just be replaced with the new formula.</li>
            <li>Using the principles above, calculate the height of the water vs time and auto fill the appropriate column.</li>
