        <h2>Task 1 Questions</h2>
        <dl>
        <dt>Why does the "element counter" script show a different number when added in different places in your document?</dt>
        <dd>
            Scripts are executed as soon as the parser finds them on the page, and
            building of the remainder of the document is paused until the script
            completes. Scripts only have access to the browser's parsed version of
            the document, not the raw text. Therefore, a script added near the top
            of the page will only see the elements that were defined before it.
        </dd>

        <dt>Why does your script need to be added after the library script?</dt>
        <dd>
            Because scripts are loaded and executed in document order. If the
            life.js script was added before the library script, the library code
            would not yet be loaded and the GameOfLife function would not yet
            be defined at the time life.js was run.

        <h2>Task 3 Questions</h2>
        <dl>
        <dt>Why do cells on the outer edge of the grid always die?</dt>
        <dd>
            The alive/dead state of the outer edge of cells is never set
            explicitly, since doing so would require different logic to determine
            the number of alive neighbours. The GameOfLife.createGrid function
            initializes all cells as dead, so they are still dead once
            the update function is finished.
        </dd>
        <dt>Why does this function create a new grid instead of reusing oldCells?</dt>
        <dd>
            In order to follow the rules correctly, each cell needs to know
            what the state of its neighbour cells was <em>before</em> the update.
            If we updated oldCells directly, we would "forget" parts of the previous
            state as we processed the grid. As a result, all but the first cell
            processed would have incomplete information about the prior state
            of its neighbours.
        </dd>
        <dt>Does the order of the if statements matter? Why or why not?</dt>
        <dd>
            No, as written the order does not matter because the conditions are
            non-overlapping. It is only ever possible for one of the three
            conditions to be true for a particular cell, and so only one of the
            blocks will ever get run.  However, if this weren't the case, the
            order <em>would</em> matter, since the effects of one block may
            influence the test condition of the next.
        </dd>
        <dt>What would happen if the inner and outer for loops were reversed?</dt>
        <dd>
            As long as the upper limit on the loop variables were set correctly
            (eg. <samp>row &lt; oldCells.length-1</samp> changed to
            <samp>row &lt; oldCells[col].length-1</samp>), it would make no
            difference at all!
        </dd>
        <dt>How do different life and death conditions affect the simulation? For example, what happens if 5 or more live neighbours are required for death by over-crowding?</dt>
        <dd>
            Answer varies depending on specific conditions adjustments. A greater
            over-crowding threshold would result in denser groups of alive cells
            and a lower likelihood of the culture dying out quickly.
