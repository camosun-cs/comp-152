sub-lists need style to remove bottom margin
asides need to be moved to the top of the elements to be positioned correctly
"element counter" disclosure needs work (made before these were a thing)
GameOfLife library link needs to be moved to github
Detail disclosures need to be added everywhere
Algorithm puzzle needs a lot of style work.
	should probably bring it out of the section completely and make it its own thing
This lab in general is way too long. We should cut task 1 completely and have the puzzle automatically run the algorithm in the page. The lab should be entirely about creating the algorithm and nothing else.
