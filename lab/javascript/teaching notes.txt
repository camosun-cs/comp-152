SETUP
=====
The files in external/ are expected to be hosted somewhere on the internet so
that the students can link to them easily without having to download copies.
I've hosted them on my server at comp152.dynu.com for this session.

The lab instructions themselves (lab.html) make use of the files in rsrc/.

The demos are self-contained (except for requiring the external/ hosted files).


PRE-LAB DEMOS
=============
The lab should start with two demonstrations.


Demo 1 = demo/element-counter.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(this is the demo referred to in Task 1 step 4)

The goals of this demo are to:
 - show the <script> syntax to link JS to HTML
 - demonstrate that scripts are executed in the order that they appear in the HTML
 - show that a single script can be embedded multiple times
 - suggest that scripts should be embedded at the _bottom_ of the page, rather
   than in the head

To run the demo:
 - open demo/element-counter.html in an editor
 - show the <script> tag, and show the script that its @src references
   -- note that closing tag is REQUIRED
 - open the page in a browser
 - move the <script> to a different part of the document and refresh
 - create a copy of the <script> in a different part of the document and refresh
 - point of the effects of document order


Demo 2 = demo/game-of-life.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goals of this demo are to:
 - show what the Game Of Life is
 - describe the life/death rules
 - clarify the boundary of what the students will be writing vs. what has been
   writen for them in the library
 - refresh the student's memory re:
   -- functions and parameters
   -- arrays (esp. 2D arrays)

To run the demo:
 - open demo/game-of-life.html in a browser
 - In "It's really a simulation" disclosure
   - first example shows
    -- interesting things can happen that aren't easy to predict
    -- may eventually reach a stable state
   - second example shows
    -- may reach a stable oscillation instead
 - In "There are very simple rules" disclosure
   - review the rules as given on Wikipedia
   - use the "step" button on each example to show the next frame
 - In "Our implementation..." disclosure
   - show the structure of the game grid, and point out
    -- array containing arrays, square (for this implementation)
    -- 0==dead, 1==alive
    -- can access a single cell like data[2][5]
 - In the last disclosure
   - discuss code structure, what calls what



DURING THE LAB
==============

Task 1, step 4 is *optional*: it is a recap of demo 1.

I expect writing the answers to the questions in step 8 of Task 1 may take too
long, so discuss the answers and encourage the students to skip, if necessary.
