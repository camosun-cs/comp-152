PRE-LAB DEMOS
=============
The lab should start with two demonstrations.


Demo 1 = demo/element-counter.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(this is the demo referred to in Task 1 step 4)

The goals of this demo are to:
 - show the <script> syntax to link JS to HTML
 - demonstrate that scripts are executed in the order that they appear in the HTML
 - show that a single script can be embedded multiple times
 - suggest that scripts should be embedded at the _bottom_ of the page, rather
   than in the head

To run the demo:
 - open demo/element-counter.html in an editor
 - show the <script> tag, and show the script that its @src references
   -- note that closing tag is REQUIRED
 - open the page in a browser
 - move the <script> to a different part of the document and refresh
 - create a copy of the <script> in a different part of the document and refresh
 - point out the effects of document order


Demo 2 = demo/game-of-life.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goals of this demo are to:
 - show what the Game Of Life is
 - describe the life/death rules
 - clarify the boundary of what the students will be writing vs. what has been
   writen for them in the library
 - refresh the student's memory re:
   -- functions and parameters
   -- arrays (esp. 2D arrays)

To run the demo:
 - open demo/game-of-life.html in a browser
 - In "It's really a simulation" disclosure
   - first example shows
    -- interesting things can happen that aren't easy to predict
    -- may eventually reach a stable state
   - second example shows
    -- may reach a stable oscillation instead
 - In "There are very simple rules" disclosure
   - review the rules as given on Wikipedia
   - use the "step" button on each example to show the next frame
 - In "Our implementation..." disclosure
   - show the structure of the game grid, and point out
    -- array containing arrays, square (for this implementation)
    -- 0==dead, 1==alive
    -- can access a single cell like data[2][5]
 - In the last disclosure
   - discuss code structure, what calls what
