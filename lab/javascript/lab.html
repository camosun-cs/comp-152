    <h2>Task 1: Adding Javascript to a web page</h2>

    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>
            <p>Create a basic HTML page called <samp><kbd>index.html</kbd></samp>
            (or <a href="index.html" download="index.html">download this template</a>
            and adjust it as appropriate).</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Basic components of a web page</summary>
                <p>Make sure that your HTML has at least:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a doctype (eg. <code class="language-markup">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>)</li>
                    <li>an <code class="language-markup">&lt;html></code> root element</li>
                    <li>a <code class="language-markup">&lt;head></code> with a <code class="language-markup">&lt;title></code></li>
                    <li>a <code class="language-markup">&lt;body></code></li>
                    <li>a heading identifying the lab (in this case, Javascript)</li>
                    <li>your name</li>
                    <li>your lab section</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>Open your <samp>index.html</samp> in a browser, and reload frequently
            as you continue the lab to see how it changes.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Add a paragraph or two to describing why the "element counter" script from the demo shows a different number when added in different places in the HTML.</p>
            <details>
            <summary>If you haven't seen the lab demo, try it yourself...</summary>
            <ol class="instructions optional">
                <li><p>Add the following code in the <samp>head</samp> of your page:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="https://telic.github.io/comp152/lab/javascript/orderIsImportant.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Move the script out of the <code>head</code> of your document and
                    put it somewhere in the middle of your <code>body</code> instead.
                    Save and refresh your browser and notice the differences.</li>
                <li>Try creating duplicates of the script in different places in your
                    document, saving and refreshing each time you make a change.</li>
                <li>While you're here, why not <a href="orderIsImportant.js">take
                    a look at the Javascript code</a>? Can you figure out how it works?</li>
                <li>Remove the element counting script when you're done so that
                    it doesn't interfere with the rest of the lab.</li>
            </ol></details>
        </li>
        <li><p>Add the following element near the bottom of your document
            to add the GameOfLife library:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="https://telic.github.io/comp152/lab/javascript/GameOfLife.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>
            <details>
                <summary>About the <code>script</code> tag</summary>
                <p><code>script</code> elements attach runnable code to your document,
                similarly to what <code>link</code> does for CSS.
                The script to run can either be defined in a separate
                file and referenced using the <code>src</code> attribute, or can
                be provided directly between the opening and closing tags.
                Most browsers only understand how to run Javascript code, so
                that's what we'll be using for this course.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Libraries versus programs</summary>
                <p>The <samp>GameOfLife.js</samp> script added in this step is
                a <dfn>library</dfn>: it defines functions for you to use
                in another script, but doesn't do anything directly on its own.
                In the next step you'll create will create a <dfn>program</dfn>
                in a separate file that does some actual work by <em>calling</em>
                the functions in the library.</p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li><p>Create a a new text file called <samp><kbd>life.js</kbd></samp>
            containing this single line of Javascript code:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">GameOfLife();</code></pre>
            <details>
                <summary>What does this code mean?</summary>
                <p>The <samp>GameOfLife.js</samp> library added earlier defines
                a function named <code class="language-javascript">GameOfLife</code>.
                This new line of code simply runs that function.</p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>Add another script tag in your HTML to link your
            new <samp>life.js</samp> script to your document, then refresh
            your browser. Make sure you add your script <em>later in the
            document</em> than the library script.  A blank Game of Life board
            will appear on your page if you've done everything correctly!</li>
    </ol>

<section id="task2">
    <h2>Task 2: The Game Of Life algorithm</h2>

    <p>The rules for Conway's Game Of Life are quite simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours also dies</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are going to create a Javascript function that applies these rules to
       an existing grid of cells (stored as a 2-dimensional array). Our function
       will determine what the "next generation" of life looks like. The library
       code provided will apply your function repeatedly over time and display
       the result after each step.</p>
    <p>Don't worry too much about the specifics of the Javascript syntax; your only
       goal is to understand the <em>algorithm</em> needed to accomplish this!</p>

    <ol class="instructions">
        <li><p>Go to the <a href="puzzle.html">puzzle page</a> in a new window, and
            solve the algorithm by drag-and-dropping the pieces into the correct
            order and nesting.</p>
            <aside>
                Feel free to discuss with the other students in your lab, and
                make sure you understand the solution!
            </aside>
        </li>
        <li>When you've finished, click the "Show my solution as code" checkbox
            and copy &amp; paste the resulting code into your <samp>life.js</samp>
            script. Make sure you copy all of it, including the closing braces
            (<code>}</code>) at the end!
        </li>
        <li><p>Provide your new <samp>updateCells</samp> function as a parameter to
            the <samp>GameOfLife</samp> function, like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">GameOfLife(updateCells);</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Save your files and refresh your browser.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Draw something on the Game Of Life board with your mouse and press
            the <samp>Step</samp> or <samp>Play</samp> button to test it out!</p>
            <details>
                <summary>It's not working!</summary>
                <p>If nothing happens, you've probably made a mistake somewhere in your
                <samp>life.js</samp> code. All modern browsers have a built-in
                tool to help find errors in Javascript code called the "Console".
                Open the Console by <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers#answer-77337">following these instructions</a> for your
                browser. The Console will describe any errors found in
                <span style="color:red">red text</span>, and will show you
                where in your file it occurred!</p>

    <h2>Task 3: Looking closer at the code</h2>
    
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>
            <p>Carefully examine your <samp>updateCells</samp> function and experiment
            with minor changes in order to answer the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why do cells on the outer edge of the grid always die?</li>
                <li>Why does this function create a new grid instead
                    of reusing <samp>oldCells</samp>?</li>
                <li>Does the order of the <samp>if</samp> statements matter?
                    Why or why not?</li>
                <li>What would happen if the inner and outer <samp>for</samp>
                    loops were reversed?</li>
                <li><strong>(bonus)</strong> How do different life and death
                    conditions affect the simulation? For example, what happens
                    if 5 or more live neighbours are required for death by
                    over-crowding?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Record your answers on your web page</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>(bonus)</strong> Using three separate <samp>if</samp>
            blocks to test neighbour conditions is messy and inefficient.
            Rewrite them as a single <samp>if</samp>, <samp>else if</samp>,
            <samp>else</samp> chain.</li>
        <li><strong>(bonus)</strong> Rewrite your <samp>updateCells</samp> function
            so that cells on the edge of the grid are considered neighbours of
            cells on the opposite edge.</li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>(bonus)</strong> The <samp>GameOfLife</samp> function returns
            an object with methods for controlling the simulation. It also accepts
            a starting grid as a second parameter. Change your code so that the
            simulation starts automatically from an interesting starting condition
            when your page loads.</p>
            <aside>
                <em>Hint:</em> you can type bits of Javascript into your browser's
                Console, and they will be run immediately. It will also show you
                the return value of bit of code you run this way. Use the Console
                to discover what methods are available on the object returned
                from <samp>GameOfLife()</samp>.
