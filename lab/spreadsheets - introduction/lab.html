        <h3>What is a Spreadsheet?</h3>

        <p>Spreadsheets could be called number processing software as opposed to
        Word, which is word processing software.  All spreadsheet software 
        (including Excel, 
        Lotus and QuattroPro) is based on a table format – numbers (and text) 
        are entered into cells, which are organized into rows and columns.  
        A spreadsheet can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Format data or calculations into an attractive table;</li>
            <li>Perform complicated or repetitive calculations;</li>
            <li>Analyze empirical (laboratory) data and determine the equation 
                that best fits the data;</li>
            <li>Graph data in many types of graphs;and</li>
            <li>Store data in a database (although Excel is not as versatile 
                or powerful as the Microsoft Access database program).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>

        <p>A spreadsheet would be suitable for the following applications:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Calculating your tax return;</li>
            <li>Preparing a cost estimate for a construction project;</li>
            <li>Recording and calculating your marks on tests and assignments 
                and then calculating each students final grade;</li>
            <li>Estimating the flow rates in a drainage or sewerage analysis and 
                calculating what pipe diameter would be required to pass the 
                flow;</li>
            <li>Calculating mortgage payments given the principal, interest rate 
                and number of payments, calculating the balance owing after each 
                payment;</li>
            <li>To count the number of days / minutes / seconds until the year 
                2010 (or any other date)</li>
            <li>Calculating the amount in an investment account each month for 
                20 years;</li>
            <li>Calculating and graphing stress and strain and graphing the 
                results in a lab; and</li>
            <li>Performing statistical analysis (such as calculating the 
                standard deviation) of a large number of data points.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Computer memory is measured in <b>bytes</b>, which is the amount of memory
    historically used to store a single character.  Because computers use a
    <em>binary</em> number system (with only two digits: 1 and 0),
    larger amounts of memory are often measured internally by power-of-2 multiples
    of bytes. For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS">NTFS</a>
    filesystem usually stores data in chunks of
    4 "kilobytes" (4 &times; 2<sup>10</sup> bytes), and modern
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> modules
    are usually measured in multiples of 2<sup>30</sup> ("giga") bytes.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, people usually measure things in the real world using 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix">SI prefixes</a>,
    which are based on powers of 10. For example, we measure distance using
    kilometers (10<sup>3</sup> meters) and power using gigawatts (10<sup>9</sup>
    watts).</p>
    <p>Confusingly, the prefix system for powers of 2 used in
    computing uses the same names as those in SI, even though they refer
    to slightly different numbers! As you can see in the figure below, the
    base-2 and base-10 prefixes are fairly close approximations of one another,
    but they diverge more and more as the prefixes get larger.</p>

    <aside class="note">
        Conventions exist that help to distinguish base-2 from base-10
        prefixes (eg. KiB vs. KB, or kB vs. KB), but they are rarely used in
        practice.
    </aside>

    <p>If that weren't confusing enough, CPU speeds and hard-drive sizes are
    usually measured and marketed using SI prefixes, while other computer
    components continue to be marketed using base-2 prefixes!</p>

    <p>In this task, you will be using Excel to compute powers of 2 and 10 up
    to the 40<sup>th</sup> prefix value and create a graph of their divergence.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Autofill is an action performed in Excel to intelligently fill cells with new data based on the data in other selected cells.  For example, if the selected cells contain the first few numbers of a simple pattern (such as three cells with 0, 1, and 2), Excel will generate more numbers that follow the sequence.</p>
                <p>To use autofill, select the cell or cells from which to you want to generate generate the patter. A small box will appear in the bottom-right corner of the selection. Click and drag from this box into one or more adjacent cells to fill into them.</p>
                <p>If the selected cell contains a formula, that formula will be filled into the new cells, and any relative references will be automatically updated (more on references below).</p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            Insert a formula into <code>B3</code> that computes 2 raised to the power of 10 times the adjacent value in column <samp>A</samp> (<samp>2<sup>10A</sup></samp>), then fill it down to the remaining 39 rows.

                </figure>
                <p>To use the value of a cell inside another cells formula, you must use a <strong>reference</strong>. To create one, type the cell's index into the formula (ex: A1), or just click on the cell to automatically insert it.</p>
                <p>By default, this will be a <strong>relative reference</strong>. This means that when autofilling this formula down into other cells using the fill handle, the references will automatically change themselves <strong>relative</strong> to each cell being filled. For example, if a formula in cell A1 is referencing cell C1, filling that formula down the column will update each cell's reference to target the cell in its own row, A2 will reference C2, and A3 will reference C3.</p>

            <li>Using autofill, enter the numbers 0 to 30 under the <samp>Time</samp> column, starting in cell A10.</li>
            <li>We know that, for time 0, the volume is still equal to the initial volume found in cell B4. The formula to calculate the volume at any point in time is: <pre><code>Initial Volume + Elapsed Time * Fill Rate</code></pre> Enter this formula into cell B10, the Volume column, substituting the cell references <code>B4</code> and <code>B5</code> in place of <samp>Initial Volume</samp> and <samp>Fill Rate</samp>, and the adjacent cell <code>A10</code> for the <samp>Elapsed Time</samp>. At Time = 0, this equation should return 20, the value of Initial Volume.</li>
            <li>Autofill the formula in B10 down for all the time intervals. Unless you've been keeping one step ahead, you'll very likely see that the results are not as expected, with most of the cells failing to evaluate. Checking the formula on one of the broken cells should show an idea of what went wrong. Like the previous task, the interval part of the formula is updating correctly for each cell, but the other two references are not. In fact, they shouldn't be updating at all. To make a reference that doesn't change during autofill, an <strong>absolute reference</strong> must be used.
            <details>
                <summary>Absolute References</summary>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, using a plain cell address in a formula creates a relative reference, which is dynamically updated when using autofill. If, instead, the reference needs to always target the same cell, as is the case when referencing a single constant number, make it an absolute reference by prefixing the row <strong>and/or</strong> column character in the address with a <code>$</code>, for example, <code>$B$5</code>. If either the row or column address is left un-prefixed, the reference will still be relative in that direction only.</p>
