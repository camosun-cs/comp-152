## Setting up the wiki

These instructions assume you are using the Wikispaces platform, but a similar procedure will likely be needed for whatever software you choose.

1. Get a list of all students and their camosun email addresses
   - these should look like username@online.camosun.ca
   - do **not** use their personal addresses, since this will inevitably cause much
     more confusion and administrative effort for you than it's worth
1. Format the list of students as CSV with two (or three) columns:
   1. username part of email address (part before @ sign)
   1. (optional) lab section
   1. full camosun email address
1. Create a new wiki using the "Create Wiki" button on the wikispaces dashboard
1. In the "Members" panel, use the "Invite People" button to add other instructors and TAs
   - remember to give them admin powers using the "Make Organizer" button once they have been added
1. Also in the "Members" panel, press "Create Code" to make it easier to add missing students later
1. Create three new pages:
   - (use the WikiText editor mode to copy/paste these files, accessible from the combo-menu on the Save button)
   - a "Sandbox" page with [this content](sandbox-content.txt)
   - a "Sources Lab Example" page with [this content](example-lab-sources.txt)
   - a "Project Task 1 Example" page with [this content](example-project-task1.txt)
1. Add some demo "good source", "bad source" comments to the bottom of the "Sources Lab Example" page
1. Edit the wiki home page to mention the course and give some basic instructions on using the wiki
   - link to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) for a good description of what wikis are
   - link to the [wikispaces documentation](http://helpcenter.wikispaces.com/customer/portal/articles/1958860-editing-a-page)
1. Add student accounts
    1. In the "Settings" panel, choose "User Creator" from the left-hand menu
    1. Choose "I will paste a text list (comma-separated or tab-separated)" from the "How would you like to enter your list?" field
    1. Copy/Paste the students CSV content into the text box that appears below, then press "Continue"
    1. Tell the wiki software which column is which, if it didn't figure it out automatically
    1. Choose "Generate passwords for me" for the "Which column contains passwords?" field
    1. Check "Send welcome e-mails to newly created users"
    1. Press "Continue"
    1. If there are any errors reported in the user list:
       - Make note of any email addresses that Wikispaces says are already in the system, and remove them using the trash-can icon
       - Adjust any usernames that Wikispaces says are already in the system by adding a number at the end
       - Use the "Verify Changes" button as required until the "Create Users" button is enabled
    1. Press "Create Users"
    1. Go back to the "Members" panel and manually invite any students whose email addresses were already registered
1. (Optional) Separate lab sections into "teams" so that different sections can re-use questions and topics without seeing the duplication
   - On the "Projects" panel, click "Create Project" and fill in the modal form
   - Click "Add Teams"
   - Choose "Upload a spreadsheet with usernames and team names", select your class list CSV using the file picker, and click "Create Teams"
   - Manually assign any remaining students by drag-and-dropping them from the "Unassigned Wiki Memebers" section into the appropriate team box
