Wiki Lab Teaching Notes
=======================

Note: these instructions are crafted for use with the Wikispaces.com platform,
and will need to be adjusted if you are using different software.

The lab time is largely a demo by the instructor, with the students
following along and participating at key points.

Use the projector to show your computer screen throughout the demo.

1. Show how to log in to D2L and get email
2. Show the Wikispaces credential email
  - point out verification link + how it only works once
3. Walk students through logging into the wiki
  - show route through dashboard aswell

Make sure everyone has successfully logged in and has been assigned to the
correct lab section before continuing. The lab section should appear in
the right-hand navigation menu, just below the “Home” panel.

New accounts can be created if needed in Settings > User Creator.

After everyone is logged in, switch to a non-admin account so that your
screen will look as similar as possible to the students’.

If you’re using Chrome or Safari, use a separate “Incognito” or “Private”
window to log in so that you can keep your admin login in the other
in case it’s needed for further user management.

4. Get everyone to navigate to the Sandbox page
5. Explain the layout of the page:
 - Wikispaces-wide tools in top bar
 - Page content in center
 - Wiki navigation in right-hand menu (will get more links over time)
 - Page tools at top-right of content area (always there, except on index page)
 - “Favourite” star button to left of page title (makes page appear in navigation)
 - inline comments in right-hand gutter of page content (yellow notes)
 - Discussion threads at bottom

6. Get everyone to enter Edit mode
7. Stay in edit mode, but tell students to Save after making some changes

You will see the edit conflict notification appear by the save button
as students make changes. Use this to gauge the participation level and
wait for everyone to try it out.

8. Briefly explain edit-conflicts - point out notification
9. Make a small change and save the page - show that your version “wins”, all other changes are “lost”

10. Demo page history
 - stress that all changes are preserved for marking purposes
 - uncheck “highlight changes” to see page as is was at selected version
 - show how to revert

11. Demo discussion threads
 - mention how Term Project Phase 1 will use discussions
 - wait for everyone to try it out

12. Point out stock user icons, show how to change them
 - need a GIF/JPG/PNG graphic first
 - click on user name in top bar
 - go to "Account"
 - click "Change" under picture

13. Demo notifications
 - list/management on Dashboard
 - automatically monitor threads you start or comment on
 - automatically monitor pages you favourite
 - “Notify” button in “…” (Options) page menu
 - “Start Monitoring” in V menu on discussion threads
 - show "Monitoring" section on Dashboard

14. Demo direct messages
 - can click on user-icons to get a message link
 - be careful with “Add all members of…” drop down!
 - note that direct messages can’t be marked

15. Open floor to questions

16. Introduce wiki lab (finding sources)
