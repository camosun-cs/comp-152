		    Frequently Asked Questions
		    </a> about finding sources on the web.
	    </p>
	</details>

	<p>Your team has been assigned a number of questions from an earlier class
	   activity.</p>

	<p><strong>For each of your assigned questions:</strong></p>
	<ol class="instructions">
		<li>
			<p>Find three public websites that address the question, and record the
			following details for each on the wiki:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a permanent URL</li>
				<li>the date you accessed the site</li>
				<li>the date the content was written</li>
				<li>the name of the author</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you cannot find any of the above details, choose a different
			resource! Missing dates and authors are a strong indicator of
			<i>unreliable</i> content.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Permanent website URLs and dates</summary>
				<p>
					Content on the web is constantly changing. Some pages may
					even change from one minute to the next! To help when referencing
					content, many websites offer "permanent" addresses (also known as
					"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalinks</a>")
					to individual articles which are less likely
					to change significantly over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some kinds of pages are so variable over time that they are
					never useful as research material. This especially includes
					<a href="https://www.google.ca/#q=cats">
					results pages from search engines</a>, and
					<a href="https://www.instagram.com/cats_of_instagram/">
					almost anything on social media sites</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even "permanent" pages aren't really permanent. Authors on
					the web are free to make changes at any time, or may simply
					not have the resources to ensure that their content stays online.
					However, if you also record the <em>date</em> that you accessed
					something online, you'll have a better chance of finding
					the content you actually used when looking for it later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some sites (such as wikis) record a log of changes over time,
					making it possible to see what has changed since you last
					visited, or even see what the content looked like at an
					earlier date. For sites that don't offer this feature, the
					<a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>
					can often provide a similar service.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Website authors</summary>
				<p>
					The name of the person responsible for the content is very
					important when assessing the credibility and biases of the
					information presented on a website. Avoid referencing content
					that does not have the real full name of a person attached to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is rarely appropriate to reference material that
					is only attributable to a company, website, or other
					organization. The main exceptions are official press-release
					materials or documents produced by committee or government.
					Other resources are often given much less editorial attention,
					have biases that are much harder to identify,
					and may not even be fully endorsed by the publishing organization.
				</p>
				<p>
					Websites with a large number of authors who aren't part of a formal
					committee (e.g. Wikipedia) aren't usually good resources for
					academic research, since their credibility is diluted by the least
					trust-worthy contributor. However, they are often useful for
					finding other resources which <em>would</em> make good
					sources by following their references!
				</p>
			</details>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Find a book or periodical available
		    from the <a href="http://camosun.ca/services/library/">Camosun library</a>
		    that addresses the question and record a permanent library catalog URL
		    or full citation on your wiki page.
		    Ensure that the full text is available online or can be physically
		    checked out for your use during this assignment.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Permanent library URLs</summary>
				<p>
					Because access to the Camosun library catalog is restricted
					by a log-in system, the URLs of pages you visit shown by your
					web browser are specific to you and will not be functional
					for other users. To work around this, the library catalog
					provides a "Permalink" feature on all catalog pages.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="do-dont.png" alt="Don't use the URL; use the 'Permalink' tool!"/>
					<figcaption>Location of the "Permalink" feature</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Always use the URL provided by the this feature when creating
					citations or otherwise sharing a source with other people!
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="permalink.png" alt="The Permalink bar"/>
					<figcaption>After clicking "Permalink", use the URL that appears in the page</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</details>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Find an informative graphic or video related to the question.
			On the wiki, record:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a permanent URL of the context in which the media was found</li>
				<li>the date you accessed the resource</li>
				<li>the date the resource was created</li>
				<li>the name of the author and copyright holder</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you cannot find any of the above details, choose a different
			resource! Copyright information (date and name) is particularly
			important when referencing media that you do not own.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>If possible, download a copy of the media from the previous step and
			attach it to your wiki page.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Copies and copyright</summary>
				<p>
					It is usually permissible under Canadian "fair dealing" laws
					to make use of copyrighted material for the purpose of study
					in an academic setting. However, these exemptions do not
					give you the right to claim copyrighted works as your own!
					It is very important to properly attribute any media you
					directly include or link to in your work to the real author
					and copyright holders.
				</p>
			</details>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>For each of the research materials found above, answer these three questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How did the author collect the information for this resource? (e.g. interviews, original research, personal experience, cited sources)</li>
				<li>What is the author's <i>agenda</i>? (i.e. why did they create this resource? Are they trying to convince you, warn you, hype something, sell something, etc?)</li>
				<li>What other biases might the author have about this material? (i.e. are they motivated to present the information in a particular light?)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>

		An example of the expected results for Task 1 is available on the wiki.

	<p class="duedate">We recommend you complete this task several days before
		the due date to give your team time to complete <a href="#task2">Task 2</a>!</p>

	<h2>Task 2: Evaluating Sources</h2>
	<p><b>Each member will be marked individually</b> for their work in this task.</p>
	<ol class="instructions">
		<li>
			<p>Read the sources your team has found and consider how
			useful each is in answering your research questions.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Questions for evaluating sources</summary>
				<ul>
					<li>Is this relevant and significant for the question at hand?</li>
					<li>Does this add any new information?</li>
					<li>Are there other aspects to your question that this source may have missed?</li>
					<li>Is the information up to date? Are there newer resources available?</li>
					<li>Is this information corroborated by another source?</li>
					<li>Do other credible sources give conflicting opinions?</li>
					<li>Is this resource peer-reviewed?</li>
					<li>Is the author an expert and/or are their sources reliable?</li>
					<li>How could the place or time this was written have affected its credibility?</li>
					<li>Is the author being paid to write this? By whom?</li>
					<li>Does the author's agenda overly bias the information?</li>

			Choose two sources that you think are the most valuable. Create a

		Please make sure all your work is contained in or linked from
		your group wiki page, and that your team-members' user names are clearly
