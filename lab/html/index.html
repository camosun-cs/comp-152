		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>Create a new folder for this lab in your "COMP156" directory</li>
			<li>
				<p>Download the <a href="template.zip" download="template.zip">starter template kit</a>, un-zip it, and move the contents to your lab folder.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>About the "index.html" file</summary>
					<p>"index.html" is a basic <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file. All web pages that you access with a web browser are made with HTML just like this one (although real sites are usually much more complicated!).</p>
					<p>HTML is a "plain-text" format; this means that the file is encoded in text and you can view and edit the file by hand in a text editor. HTML is also an example of a <dfn>markup language</dfn>: it is a mix of regular readable text and special <em>markup</em> commands that give the text meaning. All the words caught between <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&gt;</em> characters are markup, and everything else is just regular text.</p>
					<p>Because of time constraints, we've provided you with this template file so that we can skip over the details of the format and get right into marking up some content. If you'd like to learn more, there are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">many</a> <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">resources</a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">online</a> that can teach you all about the nitty-gritties!</p>
					<p>The name "index.html" is a little special. Most web servers will display this file by default if a particular file is not specified. So, for example, <a href="../">https://telic.github.io/comp152/</a> and <a href="../index.html">https://telic.github.io/comp152/index.html</a> are actually the exact same resource!</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Open "index.html" in a web browser. Keep this window open while you work, using the "refresh" button to see the affect of your changes.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>About browsers</summary>
					<p>Web browsers are "viewers" for HTML. Everything you see on the Internet is written in HTML. In fact, if you right-click in your browser on any web page, including this one, there is a "View Page Source" option that will show you the raw HTML that it is made of! There are many different web browsers available, but at their core they all just display HTML. If you code your HTML correctly, all browsers should show you the same result.</p>
					<p>Usually, a web browser does double duty of first <em>downloading</em> the HTML and connected resources from the Internet to your computer and then <em>displaying</em> them. In this lab, you already have the HTML on your computer, so the browser only needs to do the second part. The end result should look the same though, and when you upload your work to a real web server in <a href="#task4">Task 4</a>, it should look exactly the same as it did on your own computer.</p>
					<p>Notice that most of the text in your "index.html" is being displayed by the browser in a big blob right now. That's because we haven't added any markup to the content yet, and so the browser doesn't know how it should be displayed. Once we've added some markup, the browser will apply some default layout that will make it much more readable.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Open "index.html" in a plain-text editor, like Notepad++</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Why Notepad++?</summary>
					<p>The built-in plain-text editor in Windows (Notepad) will work for editing HTML, but a "code" editor like Notepad++ will give you a number of benefits, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>syntax coloring to help to distinguish between markup and regular text</li>
						<li>multiple levels of undo</li>
						<li>warnings for common encoding errors</li>
						<li>more powerful search and replace tools</li>
						<li>visible indentation guides</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Add a title to the document using an <strong><code>h1</code> element</strong> at the top of the document body.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Tags, Elements, and Comments</summary>
					<p>The markup commands in HTML are called <dfn>tags</dfn> and always start with a "&lt;" character and end with a "&gt;" character.</p>
					<p>The two main kinds of tags are <dfn>opening tags</dfn> (like <code class="language-markup">&lt;body&gt;</code>) and <dfn>closing tags</dfn> (like <code class="language-markup">&lt;/body&gt;</code>). Both have text inside the "&lt;&hellip;&gt;" that gives the "name" of the tag, but closing tags always start with a "/" character after the initial "&lt;". Tag names are case-insensitive, so "BODY" and "body" are equivalent. A pair of opening and closing tags with the same name create an <dfn>element</dfn>. Everything between the opening and closing tags of an element is that element's "content."</p>
					<p>For example, the code <code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;hello world&lt;/h1&gt;</code> defines an <strong>h1 element</strong> with the content "hello world" using a pair of opening and closing tags.</p>
					<p>Elements should not partially overlap one another: one element should always either fully contain or be fully contained in the other. For example, <code class="language-markup">&lt;a&gt;one &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code> is invalid markup, but <code class="language-markup">&lt;a&gt;one &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> is fine!</p>
					<p>Tags beginning with "<code>&lt;!--</code>" and ending with "<code>--&gt;</code>" are <dfn>comments</dfn>. Comments are hidden from normal display, and are mainly useful for leaving yourself notes for editing. We've included some comments in the template to show you where to insert new content at each step.</p>
					<p>Other tags starting with "<code>&lt;!</code>" are <dfn>processing instructions</dfn>. These are rarely used in HTML, except for the "DOCTYPE" instruction at the top of the file that declares that this is an HTML document.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>HTML headings</summary>
					<p>Headers in HTML work similarly to how they do in MS Word. Headers create implicit sections in your document, and are a great help when scanning the content of a long page.</p>
					<p>There are six levels of headings in HTML, numbered from level 1 (the highest, most important heading) to 6 (the deepest, least important) which are created using the <code class="language-markup">&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code class="language-markup">&lt;h2&gt;</code>, through to <code class="language-markup">&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags.</p>
					<p>Your web browser has some built-in styles for headers that make them stand out from the surrounding text, but you can modify their look with CSS (discussed later).</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Wrap Ian Hickson's article in a <strong><code>section</code> element</strong>. Give the section an <strong>"<code>id</code>" attribute</strong> with a value of "hixie".</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Structural elements</summary>
					<p>There are many structural elements in HTML (such as <code>nav</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>section</code>, and <code>footer</code>) that have no immediate visible affect in the browser. These elements add explicit structural heirarchy to your document which can be useful when adding styles and help when processing your document with other tools (like screen readers, search engines, and mobile "reader" view).</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>HTML attributes</summary>
					<p>Attributes are extra bits information that can be added to an opening tag. A single tag can have as many attributes added to it as you like, but the particular attributes that are meaningful varies for different kinds of elements.</p>
					<p>Attributes are added into an opening tag after the tag's name, separated by spaces. Most attributes have a name and a quoted value, joined with an equals sign. For example:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;section id="hixie"&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>creates a section tag with an <code>id</code> attribute with a value of "hixie". As another example,</p>
					<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="kitty.png" alt="A kitteh"&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>creates an <code>img</code> tag with two attributes: a <code>src</code> attribute with a value of "kitty.png", and an <code>alt</code> attribute with a value of "A kitteh".</p>
					<p>Some attributes don't require a value. In these cases, you should leave out the equals sign too. For example,</p>
					<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;details open&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>creates a <code>details</code> tag with the <code>open</code> attribute.</p>
					<p>The <code>id</code> attribute can be added to any element in HTML. Its value should be a unique identifier within the document, which can be used to refer to that particular element. IDs are also useful for creating in-document links. After you add the "hixie" ID to your section, you should be able to jump to this section using the "HTML is the new HTML5" link at the top of the document.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>Turn the title of Hickson's article into a <strong>second level header</strong>.</li>
			<li>
				<p>There is a list of numbered items in the article. Mark them up as an <strong>ordered list</strong> using <code>ol</code> (ordered list) and <code>li</code> (list item) elements.</p>
				<aside>
					<em>Note:</em> The browser will automatically add numbers to each list item in an ordered list. Because of this, the numbers written in the original document are no longer needed.
				</aside>
				<details>
					<summary>HTML Lists</summary>
					<p>HTML lists are constructed using two elements in tandem. The list as a whole is wrapped in either a <code>ol</code> or <code>ul</code> element (for ordered or unordered lists respectively). Each item of the list is wrapped in a <code>li</code> (list-item) element.</p>
					<p>By default, the browser will indent lists to make them stand out a bit from the text around them, and put each item on a separate line. Ordered lists will be given generated numbers for each item, whereas unordered lists will get bullets.</p>
					<p>There is an example of an unordered list at the top of your "index.html" file in the navigation section.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>The remaining text blocks in Hickson's article are all basic <strong>paragraphs</strong>. Wrap each block using <code>p</code> (paragraph) elements.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Change the acronym "WHATWG" into a <strong>link</strong> to <a href="https://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5">https://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5</a> using an <code>a</code> element with an <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Creating links</summary>
					<p>The <code>a</code> element on its own creates an "anchor" which doesn't do a whole lot on its own. In order to link to another resource, you'll need to add an <code>href</code> attribute into the opening tag whose value is the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to the linked resource. In this case, the href should have a value of "https://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5".</p>
					<p>You can link to any resource that has a URL, even if it's not an HTML page. If you click on a link to a resource that your browser cannot display, it will download that resource to your computer instead.</p>
					<p>You can link to sections of a document using URL "fragments". Anything after a "#" symbol in a URL is a "fragment", and it if matches the ID of an element in a web page the browser will automatically scroll to it. You can see examples of this in the <code>nav</code> section of your document.</p>
					<p>URLs can be shortened significantly by using <em>relative</em> addresses. To access a resource in the same folder as the current page, you can simply give the name of the file as the URL. To link to a section in your document, you can leave out everything in the address before the "#" symbol.

			</li>
			<li>Add a new section with an ID of "review", a level-2 heading, and a paragraph describing what the hardest part of this lab has been so far.</li>
			<li>For extra WOW factor marks, add more links where appropriate or try out some other HTML tags we haven't covered here.</li>

		<h2>Task 2: Embedded Media</h2>
		<p>Since HTML is a plain-text format, you can't directly embed a binary image into it like you would in MS Word. Instead, you'll need to link the image into the document, similar to how you "live linked" an Excel sheet into your Word document.</p>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p>Find and <strong>download</strong> a reasonably large image off of the internet. Make sure you have the right to use this image in your work.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>File size considerations on the web</summary>
					<p>Large images and video can have very large file sizes. When working with these kinds of resources on your own computer this isn't a problem, but on the Internet, the size of your resources can greatly impact the experience of using your site. Larger files take more time for you browser to download, and cost your readers time and money! In general, its a good idea to keep your HTML under 100 KB in size, keep the size of included images and stylesheets to a minimum (1 MB is a good upper limit), and never load videos automatically.</p>
					<p><strong>Please keep the file size of your image for this lab under 500 KB.</strong></p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>Move this image into your lab folder, and give it a short and simple name.</li>
			<li>Create an empty <strong><code>figure</code> element</strong> with an ID of "myfigure" between the closing tag of the "hixie" section and opening tag of the "review" section.</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Add an <code>img</code></strong> tag with <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> attributes inside the <code>figure</code> to embed your image.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Images</summary>
					<p><code>img</code> is a "self-closing" tag used for embedding images. It looks like this:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="kitty.png" alt="A kitteh"&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>Note that this element does not get a closing tag, since it does not need to contain any text in the document.</p>
					<p>The <code>src</code> attribute defines the location of the image using a URL. The text in the <code>alt</code> attribute is displayed in non-graphical browsers or if the image fails to load, so make it descriptive.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>Add a <strong>relevant caption</strong> to the <code>figure</code> using the <code>figcaption</code> element, either above or below the image.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="task3">
		<h2>Task 3: Style</h2>
		<p>By now you should have a web page that looks like a very basic document. Now that it is well structured in HTML, you can apply styles to it to change the appearance. This is done by linking one or more <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> files to your document.</p>
		<p>CSS and HTML are <em>completely separate languages</em>, although in practice they are almost always used together. HTML provides structured <b>content</b> and <b>semantics</b>, while CSS controls the <b>presentation</b> of structured content. We won't dive into how to craft your own CSS in this course, but we encourage you to look at the code for the stylesheets we've provided and try to make some small changes! CSS is a plain-text format which can be opened and edited in Notepad++ alongside your HTML.</p>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p><strong>Add a reference</strong> to the CSS file at <a href="template/basic.css">https://telic.github.io/comp152/lab/template/basic.css</a> in the <code>head</code> section of the html document using the <code>link</code> element.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Linking Style sheets</summary>
					<p>The <code>link</code> element is a self-closing tag used to reference external resources to the html document. It must be placed inside the <code>head</code> section of the document (near the top).</p>
					<p>For linking a style sheet, there are two attributes that must be included:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>The <code>rel</code> attribute describes the <em>relationship</em> of the linked file. In this case, it will be a style sheet for this document. The <code>href</code> attribute, just like anchor links, defines the location of the file as a URL.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li><b>Check the result</b> in your browser. Your document should look very similar to these lab instructions now!</li>
			<li>Your lab folder should contain two other style sheets in the <samp>styles</samp> subdirectory. <strong>Change the <code>href</code> attribute</strong> of your new link to reference one of these, and <strong>observe the changes</strong> in your browser.</li>
			<li>Choose your favorite of the two local style sheets and change the link to it.</li>
			<li>
				<p>For extra WOW factor marks, make some small changes of your own to your chosen style sheet. Those color values should look pretty familiar&hellip;</p>
				<details>
					<summary>CSS Basics</summary>
					<p>CSS works by "binding" a set of <em>style properties</em> to a set of <em>structural elements</em>. When a stylesheet is linked to an HTML document, any element in the HTML that matches a bound set in the CSS gets the associated style properties applied to it. For example, consider the following line of CSS code:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-css">p { color: red; }</code></pre>
					<p>This line creates a binding (also known as a <dfn>rule</dfn>) between the set of structural elements called <code>p</code> and the single <code>color</code> style property (which changes the color of the text). As such, text inside any <code>p</code> elements will be colored red. The text before the first <code class="language-css">{</code> is called a <dfn>selector</dfn>: it "selects" what elements will be included in the binding. Between the <code class="language-css">{</code> and <code class="language-css">}</code> you may include any number of <code class="language-css">property: value;</code> pairs to define the style properties that will be set.</p>

		<h2>Task 4: Uploading</h2>
		<figure><img src="filezilla.png" alt="Filezilla interface" /></figure>
		<p>So far you've been viewing your web page from the filesystem on your own computer. No one but you has access to it here; you need to <em>publish</em> it to a web server for others to be able to view it over the Internet.</p>
		<p>You will be uploading your web page to a server using <abbr title="Secure File Transfer Protocol">sFTP</abbr>. There are many different programs that use this protocol, and any will do the job. The lab computers have a program called FileZilla for this purpose.</p>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>Launch FileZilla (or any other program that supports sFTP)</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Connect</strong> to <a href="sftp://studentlabs.cs.camosun.bc.ca">studentlabs.cs.camosun.bc.ca</a> using your D2L account information.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Connecting to the server using FileZilla</summary>
					<p>Near the top of the FileZilla window are fields used for connecting to a server.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The first field is for the host address, which is <samp>studentlabs.cs.camosun.bc.ca</samp>. The is the unique name of the server you are connecting to.</li>
						<li>The next two fields are for the username and password of the account you want to use to connect. In this case, fill these in with your D2L account name and password.</li>
						<li>Enter "22" into the <samp>Port</samp> field.</li>
						<li>Click the <samp>Quickconnect</samp> button after filling in the required fields to connect to the server. The dropdown arrow next to it saves a list of servers and login information used in the past.</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Create a new directory called <kbd>html-lab</kbd> inside of the <samp>public_html</samp> directory that appears in your home folder <em>on the server</em></p>
				<details>
					<summary>Navigating FileZilla</summary>
					<p>The main interface of FileZilla is divided into two columns. On the left, it shows the files on your local machine, with the folder hierarchy on top, and the contents of the selected folder below. On the right is the file structure on the server.</p>
					<p>To copy files or folders from your local system to the server and vise-versa, first navigate to the folder of the item(s) you want to copy, and to the desired destination folder on the target machine. Then, simply drag the files/folders from one pane to the other. If there is a naming conflict (the transferred file already exists on the target machine), a pop-up window will appear with options for resolving the conflict.</p>
					<p>Note that double-clicking files in FileZilla doesn't <em>open</em> them as usual. Instead, double-clicking will transfer the file as if it were dragged to the opposite pane.</p>
					<p>You can create a new directory by right-clicking on the containing folder in the hierarchy, and selecting <samp>create directory</samp>. You can also open the containing folder and right click in the empty space in its content view.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Navigate to the folder containing your lab files on your local machine and copy the contents to the new folder on the server.</p>
				<aside>
					<em>Note:</em> Make sure your index.html file is directly inside the lab7 folder and not in a subdirectory.
				</aside>
			</li>
			<li>
				Double-check that the file permissions on the server are set properly to allow access to the public.
			</li>
			<li>If you navigate your browser to <samp>http://studentlabs.cs.camosun.bc.ca/~<em>user_name</em>/html-lab/</samp>, you should be able to see your webpage. Try having a lab-mate view your page on their device.</li>
