    <h2>Task 1: Powers of 2, Powers of 10</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Computer memory is measured in <b>bytes</b>, which is the amount of memory
    historically used to store a single character.  Because computers use a
    <em>binary</em> number system (with only two digits: 1 and 0),
    larger amounts of memory are often measured internally by power-of-2 multiples
    of bytes. For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS">NTFS</a>
    filesystem usually stores data in chunks of
    4 "kilobytes" (4 &times; 2<sup>10</sup> bytes), and modern
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> modules
    are usually measured in multiples of 2<sup>30</sup> ("giga") bytes.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, people usually measure things in the real world using
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix">SI prefixes</a>,
    which are based on powers of 10. For example, we measure distance using
    kilometers (10<sup>3</sup> meters) and power using gigawatts (10<sup>9</sup>
    watts).</p>
    <p>Confusingly, the prefix system for powers of 2 used in
    computing uses the same names as those in SI, even though they refer
    to slightly different numbers! As you can see in the figure below, the
    base-2 and base-10 prefixes are fairly close approximations of one another,
    but they diverge more and more as the prefixes get larger.</p>
    <aside class="note">
        Conventions exist that help to distinguish base-2 from base-10
        prefixes (eg. KiB vs. KB, or kB vs. KB), but they are rarely used in
        practice.

    <p>If that weren't confusing enough, CPU speeds and hard-drive sizes are
    usually measured and marketed using SI prefixes, while other computer
    components continue to be marketed using base-2 prefixes!</p>

    <p>In this task, you will be using Excel to compute powers of 2 and 10 up
    to the 40<sup>th</sup> prefix value and create a graph of their divergence.</p>

                <p>Selected cells will have a small box in the bottom-right corner of the selection area. If you click and drag this into adjacent cells, Excel will intelligently generate data based on the selected content into the new cells.</p>
                <p>For example, if the selected cells contain the first few numbers of a simple pattern (such as three cells with 0, 1, and 2), Excel will generate more numbers that follow the sequence.</p>
                <p>If the selected cell contains a formula, that formula will be filled into the new cells, and any relative references will be automatically updated (more on references below).</p>

                </figure>
                <p>To use the value of a cell inside another cells formula, you must use a <strong>reference</strong>. To create one, type the cell's index into the formula (ex: A1), or just click on the cell to automatically insert it.</p>
                <p>By default, this will be a <strong>relative reference</strong>. This means that when filling this formula down into other cells using the fill handle, the references will automatically change themselves <strong>relative</strong> to each cell being filled. For example, if a formula in cell A1 is referencing cell C1, filling that formula down the column will update each cell's reference to target the cell in its own row, A2 will reference C2, and A3 will reference C3.</p>
                <p>If this behaviour is undesired, an <strong>absolute reference</strong> is required. In the previous example, if the reference in the formula was changed to C$1, each newly filled cell (A2,A3,etc) will still reference cell C1. The <samp>$</samp> symbol before the row index tells Excel to always reference a cell in row 1. It can also be added before the column index ($C1) to only reference that column, or added to both ($C$1) to only ever reference that specific cell.</p>

    <h2>Task 2: Importing and Displaying Data</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In this section, you will be comparing and displaying historical climate data from <a  href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/">http://climate.weather.gc.ca/</a>.</p>
    <p>Your task is to import daily climate data collected by a Victoria weather station for the years 2016 and 1973, then create a chart that clearly compares the two years.</p>
    <h3>2.1: Downloading data</h3>

        <figcaption>Victoria Gonzales weather station data report</figcaption>
    </figure></li>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Go to <a href ="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=114">http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=114</a>. This page contains the data records for the Gonzales weather station in Victoria, BC.
        <li>In the date field (shown in the figure above), set the year to 1973 and click Go (you can ignore the month field).</li>
        <li>Download CSV files of the years 1973 and 2016. To do this, first set the year in the date field (you can ignore the month) and click <samp>Go</samp> to load that year's climate data. Then make sure <samp>CSV</samp> is selected in the download area and click <samp>Download Data</samp>
        <details>
            <summary>What is CSV?</summary>
            <p>
                <abbr title="Comma-separated values">CSV</abbr>
                is a <strong>plain-text</strong>
                format for storing tabular data. Each row of the table is stored
                on a single line in the file, and each column within a row is
                delimited using commas. Because of this file type's simple structure,
                individual cells may not contain multiple lines of text and may not
                contain commas.
            </p>

    <h3>2.2: Preparing data</h3>
    <figure class="right">
        <img src="img/climate_data.png">
    </figure>
    <p>The two datasets you downloaded contain a lot of unneeded information. They will need some cleanup to be made usable and easily comparable.</p>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Open each csv file in a Excel and delete the first 25 rows of header information in both of them. A quick way to do this is to click and drag along the row label numbers on the left, then click <samp>Delete</samp> in the right-click context menu.</li>
        <li>Copy the <samp>Date/Time</samp> column (column <samp>A</samp>) from either of the datasets, then switch back to your Excel file from <a href="#task1">Task 1</a> and paste it into Column <samp>A</samp> of a new worksheet. Name this new worksheet <kbd>Climate data</kbd></li>
        <li>Copy/paste the <samp>Mean Temp (°C)</samp> columns (column <samp>J</samp>) from the 1973 and 2016 data sets into Columns <samp>B</samp> and <samp>C</samp> of the <samp>Climate data</samp> worksheet. Rename their headers <kbd>1973</kbd> and <kbd>2016</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Change the date format of the <samp>Date/Time</samp> column to remove the year.</p>

                <summary>Cell Formatting</summary>
                <p>Right-clicking one or more cells and selecting <samp>Format Cells</samp> opens the Format Cells window. This window contains various options for changing the look of the cell and its contents. The <samp>Number</samp> tab allows you to choose what type of data the cell contains and how it should be displayed. For example, selecting <samp>Currency</samp> will preface numbers with a $ symbol, add commas and limit decimal places.</p>
                <p>To create custom formatting rules (which you will need here), select the <samp>Custom</samp> category. This view allows you to manually edit the <strong>number format code</strong>. Select one of the supplied codes to use it as a starting point, then modify it in the <samp>Type:</samp> field.</p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>Confirm that your climate data looks similar to the figure above.</li>

                <p>To add elements to a chart, first select the chart, then use the <samp>Add Chart Element</samp> button in the <samp>Design</samp> ribbon. You can also use the plus icon that appears in the top-right of the selected chart, but its options are fairly limited. You can delete an element by selecting <samp>Delete</samp> in its right-click context menu.</p>
                <p>Clicking any element in the chart will select it and bring up its options in a sidebar.</p>
                <ul>

            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            Change the visual formatting of the four lines on the chart to put emphasis on the monthly trend lines. In the example chart shown above, the trend lines were given a <samp>Width</samp> of <kbd>3 pts</kbd> and a <samp>Dash type</samp> set to <kbd>Solid</kbd>. The series lines have a <samp>Transparency</samp> of <kbd>60%</kbd> and a <samp>Width</samp> of <kbd>1 pt</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Adjust the <samp>Bounds</samp> of the vertical axis to better fit the data. The example chart uses a minimum of <kbd>-5.0</kbd> and a maximum of <kbd>30.0</kbd></li>
        <li>
            <p>Use additional formatting options to improve the readability of the chart as you see fit. Some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A descriptive title.</li>
                <li>A y-axis title that specifies the units.</li>
                <li>Simplify and reduce the unit labels on the x-axis.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Move the chart to a new sheet using the <samp>Move Chart</samp> button in the chart's <samp>Design</samp> ribbon. Name this new sheet <kbd>Climate chart</kbd></li>
